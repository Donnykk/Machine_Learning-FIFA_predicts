## 1. Introduction ##

Football is one of the most popular sports in the world, and the 2022 World Cup is in full swing these days. As an avid
football fan, I decided to write a football-related machine learning model. After looking for some datasets and 
others' previous work on the Internet, I chose to use some machine-learning skills to predict the results of 
football games.

* About the dataset

    After a bit of searching and filtering, I chose a dataset of Premier League matches from 2000 to 2018.
    
    In the dataset, all data is in csv format, ready for use within standard spreadsheet applications. The dataset was 
crawled from the website http://football-data.co.uk/notes.txt which collects official match statistics from Sportinglife, 
ESPN Soccer, Bundesliga.de, Gazzetta.it and Football.fr.

* Some keys in the dataset

  * Div = League Division <br>
  * Date = Match Date (dd/mm/yy) <br>
  * HomeTeam = Home Team <br>
  * AwayTeam = Away Team <br>
  * FTHG and HG = Full Time Home Team Goals <br>
  * FTAG and AG = Full Time Away Team Goals <br>
  * FTR and Res = Full Time Result (H=Home Win, D=Draw, A=Away Win) <br>
  * HTHG = Half Time Home Team Goals <br>
  * HTAG = Half Time Away Team Goals <br>
  * HTR = Half Time Result (H=Home Win, D=Draw, A=Away Win) <br>

* Match Statistics (where available)

  * Attendance = Crowd Attendance <br>
  * Referee = Match Referee <br>
  * HS = Home Team Shots <br>
  * AS = Away Team Shots <br>
  * HST = Home Team Shots on Target <br>
  * AST = Away Team Shots on Target <br>
  * HHW = Home Team Hit Woodwork <br>
  * AHW = Away Team Hit Woodwork <br>
  * HC = Home Team Corners <br>
  * AC = Away Team Corners <br>
  * HF = Home Team Fouls Committed <br>
  * AF = Away Team Fouls Committed <br>
  * HFKC = Home Team Free Kicks Conceded <br>
  * AFKC = Away Team Free Kicks Conceded <br>
  * HO = Home Team Offsides <br>
  * AO = Away Team Offsides <br>
  * HY = Home Team Yellow Cards <br>
  * AY = Away Team Yellow Cards <br>
  * HR = Home Team Red Cards <br>
  * AR = Away Team Red Cards <br>
  * HBP = Home Team Bookings Points (10 = yellow, 25 = red) <br>
  * ABP = Away Team Bookings Points (10 = yellow, 25 = red) <br>

  Note that Free Kicks Conceeded includes fouls, offsides and any other offense committed and will always be equal to 
  or higher than the number of fouls. Fouls make up the vast majority of Free Kicks Conceded. Free Kicks Conceded are 
  shown when specific data on Fouls are not available (France 2nd, Belgium 1st and Greece 1st divisions). <br>

  Note also that English and Scottish yellow cards do not include the initial yellow card when a second is shown to a 
  player converting it into a red, but this is included as a yellow (plus red) for European games. 

  &nbsp;

* The dataset is available at: https://momodel.cn/explore/5cc56cf71afd9422f849552d?type=dataset

## 2. Goals of the Project ##

The main purpose of this project is to evaluate the detailed match data to select the proper X_label that has a great 
impact on match results, and use the match results as y_label (Win / Lose / Draw) to predict the match results 
with machine learning classifier models and deep learning neural network.

## 3. Pre-processing of data ##

* Firstly, let's take a look at the structure of data:

  ![](./src/structure.png)

### Feature engineering ###

* Feature engineering refers to the process of transforming raw data into training data for a model, with the goal of 
  obtaining better features of the training data and thus better trained models. Feature engineering can improve the 
  performance of models, sometimes even on simple models. Feature engineering plays a very important role in machine 
  learning, which is generally considered to include feature construction, feature extraction and feature selection.

* Because the league is a season of the year, there is a sequence, then we can count the number of goal 
  difference between the home and away teams in the whole season up to this game. Then for each week of the season, 
  calculate the difference between the number of goals scored and the number of goals conceded by each team so far this 
  week, which is the goal difference. The detailed code can be seen in the following two methods:
  
  ```python
  def get_goals_diff(playing_stat):
    teams = {}
    for i in playing_stat.groupby('HomeTeam').mean().T.columns:
        teams[i] = []
    for i in range(len(playing_stat)):
        # home court goals score
        HTGS = playing_stat.iloc[i]['FTHG']
        # away from home court goals score
        ATGS = playing_stat.iloc[i]['FTAG']
        teams[playing_stat.iloc[i].HomeTeam].append(HTGS - ATGS)
        teams[playing_stat.iloc[i].AwayTeam].append(ATGS - HTGS)
    goalsDifference = pd.DataFrame(data=teams, index=[i for i in range(1, 39)]).T
    goalsDifference[0] = 0
    for i in range(2, 39):
        goalsDifference[i] = goalsDifference[i] + goalsDifference[i - 1]
    return goalsDifference


  def get_gss(playing_stat):
      goalsDifference = get_goals_diff(playing_stat)
      j = 0
      HTGD = []
      ATGD = []
      for i in range(380):
          ht = playing_stat.iloc[i].HomeTeam
          at = playing_stat.iloc[i].AwayTeam
          HTGD.append(goalsDifference.loc[ht][j])
          ATGD.append(goalsDifference.loc[at][j])
          if ((i + 1) % 10) == 0:
              j = j + 1
      playing_stat.loc[:, 'HTGD'] = HTGD
      playing_stat.loc[:, 'ATGD'] = ATGD
      return playing_stat
  ```
  
* Total points scored by home and away teams throughout the season up to the current game week is also an important
    metric. A win counts for 3 points, a draw counts for 1, and a loss counts for 0. I calculate this value based on 
    the results of games played before this week of the season. 
    
    We compute HTP (accumulated points for the home team this season as of this week) and ATP 
    (accumulated points for the away team this season as of this week).
    
    The detailed code can be seen in the following methods:
    
    ```python
    def get_points(result):
        if result == 'W':
            return 3
        elif result == 'D':
            return 1
        else:
            return 0


    # calculate the total points of the season
    def get_total_points(match_res):
        match_points = match_res.applymap(get_points)
        for i in range(2, 39):
            match_points[i] = match_points[i] + match_points[i - 1]
        match_points.insert(column=0, loc=0, value=[0 * i for i in range(20)])
        return match_points


    def get_result(playing_stat):
        teams = {}
        for i in playing_stat.groupby('HomeTeam').mean().T.columns:
            teams[i] = []
        for i in range(len(playing_stat)):
            if playing_stat.iloc[i].FTR == 'H':
                teams[playing_stat.iloc[i].HomeTeam].append('W')
                teams[playing_stat.iloc[i].AwayTeam].append('L')
            elif playing_stat.iloc[i].FTR == 'A':
                teams[playing_stat.iloc[i].AwayTeam].append('W')
                teams[playing_stat.iloc[i].HomeTeam].append('L')
            else:
                teams[playing_stat.iloc[i].AwayTeam].append('D')
                teams[playing_stat.iloc[i].HomeTeam].append('D')
        return pd.DataFrame(data=teams, index=[i for i in range(1, 39)]).T


    # insert the H and A results into the table
    def get_agg_points(playing_stat):
        match_res = get_result(playing_stat)
        cum_pts = get_total_points(match_res)
        HTP = []
        ATP = []
        j = 0
        for i in range(380):
            ht = playing_stat.iloc[i].HomeTeam
            at = playing_stat.iloc[i].AwayTeam
            HTP.append(cum_pts.loc[ht][j])
            ATP.append(cum_pts.loc[at][j])
            if ((i + 1) % 10) == 0:
                j = j + 1
        playing_stat.loc[:, 'HTP'] = HTP
        playing_stat.loc[:, 'ATP'] = ATP
        return playing_stat
    ```

* Previously, I construct some features that reflect a team's all-time performance for the season, and now let's    look at the team's performance over the last three games.

    use HM1 to represent the home team's last win or loss,

    use AM1 to represent the win or loss of the last game played by the away team.

    Similarly, HM2 AM2 is the win or loss of the last game, and HM3 AM3 is the win or loss of the last game.

    The detailed code can be seen in the following methods:

    ```python
    def get_recent(playing_stat, num):
        recent = get_result(playing_stat)
        recent_final = recent.copy()
        for i in range(num, 39):
            recent_final[i] = ''
            j = 0
            while j < num:
                recent_final[i] += recent[i - j]
                j += 1
        return recent_final


    def add_recent(playing_stat, num):
        recent = get_recent(playing_stat, num)
        # M represents unknown
        h = ['M' for _ in range(num * 10)]
        a = ['M' for _ in range(num * 10)]
        j = num
        for i in range((num * 10), 380):
            ht = playing_stat.iloc[i].HomeTeam
            at = playing_stat.iloc[i].AwayTeam
            past = recent.loc[ht][j]
            h.append(past[num - 1])
            past = recent.loc[at][j]
            a.append(past[num - 1])
            if ((i + 1) % 10) == 0:
                j = j + 1
        playing_stat['HM' + str(num)] = h
        playing_stat['AM' + str(num)] = a
        return playing_stat


    def add_recent_df(playing_statistics_):
        playing_statistics_ = add_recent(playing_statistics_, 1)
        playing_statistics_ = add_recent(playing_statistics_, 2)
        playing_statistics_ = add_recent(playing_statistics_, 3)
        return playing_statistics_
    ```

* Then I put in the game week information, which is the week in which the game took place.
    ```python
    def get_mw(playing_stat):
        j = 1
        MatchWeek = []
        for i in range(380):
            MatchWeek.append(j)
            if ((i + 1) % 10) == 0:
                j = j + 1
        playing_stat['MW'] = MatchWeek
        return playing_stat
    ```

* Then I combine all the matches in the dataset into a single table, and divide the scores and goal difference that I just calculated by the number of weeks to get the weekly average. 

    After constructing the features, it is found that the proportion of home wins is close to 50%, so the proportion of labels is unbalanced for this three-class classification problem.

    I reduce it to a binary classification problem of whether the home team wins or not, which is also a way to solve the problem of imbalance in the proportion of labels

    Then I perform max-min normalization on the feature HTP of all matches.

    ```python
    def convert_(data):
        max_ = data.max()
        min_ = data.min()
        return (data - min_) / (max_ - min_)


    r_data = convert_(X_all['HTGD'])
    cols = [['HTGD', 'ATGD', 'HTP', 'ATP']]
    for col in cols:
        X_all[col] = scale(X_all[col])
    ```

* In order to see the correlation between features, I generate Pearson correlation heatmap:

    ![](./src/pearson.png)

    From the figure, we can see that the HTP feature and HTGD feature are strongly correlated, and similarly the ATP feature and ATGD feature are strongly correlated. This is also easy to understand, the higher the home weekly average score, then the home weekly average goal difference is also higher. Here we would consider removing the two features HTP and ATP and keeping the two features HTGD and ATGD. At the same time, we can also see that the result of the last team's game has little influence on the result of the current game, and we consider retaining these features here.

    At last, let's look at the top 10 features that are most relevant to FTR:

    ![](./src/relation.png)

    We can see that the most relevant feature is HTGD, indicating that the higher a team's average weekly home goal difference is, the more likely they are to win.


## 4. Training Models ##

Now I've got training data and test data prepared, let's introduce the machine learning model I used for this project.

* Logistic Regression

    Logistic regression model assumes that the data obey the Bernoulli distribution, and achieve the purpose of binary classification of data through the method of maximizing the likelihood function, using gradient descent to solve the parameters. 
    
    The main advantage of this model is that it has good interpretability. If feature engineering is good enough, the model will work very well. It's also vary fast to train; The output is also easy to adjust. However, the shortcomings of this model are also very prominent, such as the relatively low accuracy and the difficulty to deal with data imbalance.

    I import the model from `sklearn.linear_model` and `random_state` is the only argument:

    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    clf_A = LogisticRegression(random_state=20)
    ```

* Support Vector Machine

    SVM is also a two-class classification model. It's based on a linear classifier that finds separating hyperplanes in the feature space that maximize the margin.

    * When the training samples are linearly separable, a linear classifier, namely linearly separable support vector machine, is learned by maximizing the hard margin;

    * When the training data is approximately linearly separable, the slack variable is introduced to learn a linear classifier, namely linear support vector machine, by maximizing the soft margin;

    * When the training data is not linearly separable, learn a nonlinear support vector machine by using the kernel technique and soft margin maximization.

    A few support vectors determine the final result, which can not only help us get the key samples and eliminate a large number of redundant samples, but also ensure that the method has good robustness.

    I import the model from `sklearn.svm` and 3 arguments (`random_state`, `kernel`, `gamma`) are required:

    ```python
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
    clf_B = SVC(random_state=20, kernel='rbf', gamma='auto')
    ```

* eXtreme Gradient Boosting

    XGBoost is a type of Boosting algorithm. The idea of Boosting is that many weak classifiers are integrated together to form a strong classifier. The basic principle is that the input samples of the next decision tree will be relevant to the training and prediction of the previous decision tree. XGBoost is a kind of boosting tree model, so it integrates many tree models together to form a strong classifier. The tree model used is the CART regression tree model.

    XGBoost is expected to be efficient, flexible and lightweight. The predicting result of this model is supposed to be better than the 2 models above.

    I import the model from `xgboost` and only `seed` argument is required:

    ```python
    import xgboost as xgb
    clf_C = xgb.XGBClassifier(seed=48)
    ```

* BP Neural Network

    Other than machine learning, I also tried deep learning models to solve this problem. I used a simple neural network, BP network, which is to add a number of layers (one layer or multiple layers) of neurons between the input layer and the output layer, these neurons are called hidden units. They have no direct contact with the outside world, but the change of their state can affect the relationship between the input and output, each layer can have a number of nodes.

    ```python
    model = keras.Sequential(
        [
            keras.layers.Input(shape=(22,), name="input"),
            keras.layers.Dense(64, activation="relu"),
            keras.layers.Dense(32, activation="relu"),
            keras.layers.Dense(1, activation="sigmoid"),
        ]
    )
    # print the model summary
    model.summary()

    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

    print("train {} model，sample number {}。".format(model.__class__.__name__, len(X_train)))

    # Set up filepath for model
    model_file_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join("data", "model"))


    # Helper function
    def get_run_logdir():
        root_logdir = os.path.join(os.curdir, "data", "logs")
        run_id = datetime.now().strftime('run_%Y_%m_%d-%H_%M_%S')
        run_log_dir = os.path.join(root_logdir, run_id)
        return run_log_dir


    # Get a file path to where to store log data
    run_logdir = get_run_logdir()

    # Set up a checkpoint that saves the best model parameters so far during training
    checkpoint_cb = keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(model_file_path)

    # Set up a callback for early stopping (which stops the training when the model stops becoming better)
    early_stopping_cb = keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(patience=50, restore_best_weights=True)

    # Set up a callback for tensorboard which can be used for visualisation
    tensorboard_cb = keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(run_logdir)

    start = time()
    history = model.fit(X_train, y_train,
                        epochs=500,
                        validation_split=0.2,
                        callbacks=[checkpoint_cb, early_stopping_cb, tensorboard_cb])
    end = time()
    print("training time {:.4f} s".format(end - start))

    # Roll back the best model
    model = keras.models.load_model(model_file_path)

    ```

## 5. Evaluation of Models ##

I used `F1 score` and `accuracy` to evaluate the performance of the model, and calculated the training and prediction time of each model. 

* Here are the results I got:

        train LogisticRegression model，sample number 2450。
        training time 0.0116 s
        predicting time in 0.0010 s
        F1 score and accuracy on training set: 0.6148 , 0.6547
        predicting time in 0.0010 s
        F1 score and accuracy on testing set: 0.6141 , 0.6624

        train SVC model，sample number 2450。
        training time 0.1674 s
        predicting time in 0.2746 s
        F1 score and accuracy on training set: 0.6176 , 0.6776
        predicting time in 0.2846 s
        F1 score and accuracy on testing set: 0.5982 , 0.6661

        train XGBClassifier model，sample number 2450。
        training time 0.0975 s
        predicting time in 0.0030 s
        F1 score and accuracy on training set: 0.9416 , 0.9461
        predicting time in 0.0040 s
        F1 score and accuracy on testing set: 0.5695 , 0.6167

        F1 score and accuracy on testing set: 0.5800 , 0.6200

According to the metrics above, it is obvious that the machine learning model I built did not achieve ideal results. Only XGBClassifier model reached a prediction accuracy and F1 score of 0.9+, but the training and predicting time of the XGBClassifier model was not as ideal as LogisticRegression. The worst model turns out to be Support Vector Machine. It only got a F1 score of 0.6141 and accuracy of 0.6624, which are both lower than I expected. Moreover, the training and predicting time of SVC are longer than other models, especially the prediction time, which shows its poor performance compared with other models.

Let's focus on the deep learning models, we can see that my BP neural network also did not achieve an expected prediction accuracy, and the training time was not good compared to LogisticRegression either.

Then I tried to modify the hyper parameters to get a better result. I tried serveral different value of the parameter `random_state` and `seed`, but there is no obvious effect on the results, which fluctuated around the results above.
So I pick the relatively better hyper parameters: `random_state = 42` and `seed = 20`

* Here's the results:

        train LogisticRegression model，sample number 2450。
        training time 0.0130 s
        predicting time in 0.0010 s
        F1 score and accuracy on training set: 0.6120 , 0.6522
        predicting time in 0.0010 s
        F1 score and accuracy on testing set: 0.6162 , 0.6645

        train SVC model，sample number 2450。

        predicting time in 0.2800 s

        predicting time in 0.2886 s
        F1 score and accuracy on testing set: 0.6070 , 0.6686

We can see that my BP neural network also did not achieve an expected prediction accuracy. Although the F1 score and accuracy on training set reached 0.8+ and seem to have the potential to increase more , the F1 score and accuracy on testing set is still dissatisfying, almost as bad as SVC and Logistic Regression. What’s important is this model is way more timing-wasting than other machine-learning models.



## 6. Conclusion ## 

To conclude, XGBClassifier turns out to be the best model in this proble with a much higher accuracy than other models, even the neural network. The LogisticRegression model has the best time performance, which is much faster in training and testing than other models;

Howerver, it's apparent that the accuracy of my models is not very satisfactory, so I can improve my model further in the future. Here are some possible solutions in my mind:

    * Get more data or use more features.

    * Process the dataset by cross-validation

    * Analyse the technical characteristics and health information of the players
